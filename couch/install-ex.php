He had always been interested in education and had been helping students in local schools with their engineering projects. Working with kids, he began to realize that the skills that made him a successful engineer were not the skills he had learned in high school or that he saw being taught in high schools.  This realization moved him to teach. And he has now been teaching engineering for four years in Freeport (one year in middle school, three in high school). He has focused on building skills through large-scale, student-led, real world projects, such as a wind tunnel that clocked the highest wind speeds ever recorded in Maine.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Amory also has a background in naval architecture and philosophy, which he studied along with engineering at Trinity College. He has a master’s degree in design studies from Harvard University. He accomplished all this after struggling as a younger student, an experience he is quick to share with his students: “I am extremely dyslexic and could not read until I was in 7th grade.” He believes every student can be taught creativity and every student can succeed.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Amory worked to design Baxter Academy’s unique Flex Friday program. Mr. Amory grew up in Portland, attending Waynflete. He lives here with his family.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Amory:  He has sailed to Norway. He has climbed mountains on every continent except South America and Antarctica. He is an outlier when it comes to math and music: “I butcher every instrument I touch, but I can press play on a CD play, iPod and cassette deck.\\\"\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"mbarnes\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Matthew Barnes - Art & Design Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/mbarnes.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:matthew.barnes@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">matthew.barnes@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMr. Barnes’s personal motto is: “He who dies with the most tools wins.” He uses his tools to hand-carve slate tombstones, to motorize toy airplanes, to add micro-cameras to Estes rockets, and to repurpose 1950s rotary phones into his home’s intercom system. He knows how to cast metal, solder wire, and weld sheet steel. He can run a lathe and drill through glass and design a textbook. (Want to see more of what he can do? Go to mattmakes.weebly.com.)\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Barnes has a bachelor’s degree in education from Notre Dame College in Manchester, N.H., and also started a successful company that designed and manufactured tiles. His most important work recently, though, has been staying home on Peaks Island with his two small children.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nBaxter has brought him back to the mainland and to the classroom.  He remembers his first visit to the school: “People were excited to be there. They WANTED to be there and it showed in everything I saw. Students helped students in unselfish, uncritical ways and supported one another. Teachers were part of their classes and waded directly into whatever was going on rather than hovering on the edges. The mantra of \\\"Let\\'s try it\\\" elevated everything happening at Baxter and for me, it was like Dorothy stepping into the colored world of Oz. I spent a long time thinking, ‘This can\\'t be actually happening,’ but it is, and I can\\'t wait to start.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Barnes: He’s a pilot, a scuba diver, and the cemetery keeper for Brackett Memorial Cemetery on Peaks. He can write with either hand and walk across the bottom of a pond. Ticks freak him out. He loves the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series and can quote anything from Monty Python (but please don’t ask him to do that in front of his family because it embarrasses them).\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"sbuhlman\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Sarah Buhlman - Instructional Specialist</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/sbuhlman.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:sarah.buhlman@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">sarah.buhlman@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMs. Buhlman comes to the Baxter adventure from a life of adventure. She grew up on a Maryland horse farm, played rugby, and spent a college semester sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii with the Sea Education Association. She fell in love with teaching while sailing on a 74-foot schooner out of Annapolis, Maryland, and she’s since been an outdoor educator in Alaska and Maine, where she spends her summers as an sailing, canoeing, and backpacking instructor for Hurricane Island Outward Bound School in Rockland. She’s spent the last two years as an AmeriCorps volunteer specializing in adventure education.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nShe has a Bachelor of Science degree in biology (botany and ecology track) from Towson University.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Buhlman worked at the REAL School on Mackworth Island last year but wanted to establish a longer lasting relationship with a Maine school. “After spending only a day with the Baxter students and staff, I could see this was the type of school I could make a home in: Someplace where the students are valued as people and not just as a number that takes a test. Where the staff is encouraged to be creative and inspire the students to discover their love of learning.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Ms. Buhlman: She once had a job preparing three meals a day for 100 campers and staff at Camp Dark Waters. She attended a Quaker high school. She works two nights a week at Trader Joe’s, and if she’s not working, she’s over at Back Cove Crossift picking up heavy things and putting them back down again at varying rates of intensity. Sailing on the schooner Woodwind, she and her fellow sailors came in second in the Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race. Her friends call her eSBee.\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"hdippolito\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Heather D\\'Ippolito - Humanities Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/hdippolito.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:heather.dippolito@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">heather.dippolito@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMs. D’Ippolito is a fifth-generation Mainer who last year returned home after a long stint teaching in New York City—five years in Brooklyn and three in the Bronx. At the Bushwick School for Social Justice, she was a tenth-grade English teacher who used project-based learning to explore texts ranging from Persepolis to Senegalese poetry to news articles on how social media played a role in the Egyptian revolution.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nHer work wasn’t confined to the classroom in Brooklyn. She developed and implemented programs to help struggling students while aligning their work with the Common Core Learning Standards. She worked on a team to develop the school’s standards-based grading policy. She served as a coordinator for student affairs and helped plan college tours and job fairs, as well as workshops on social justice issues.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMost recently she has been the Jobs for Maine’s Graduates teacher at Bonny Eagle High School.

He is teaching science at Baxter. He has taught a wide range of physical and life science classes including physics, geology, chemistry, and biology. Mr. Doughty believes “that good science education--like good science--starts with inquiry, travels through data and analysis, and reaches conclusions that lead inevitably to new questions.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nHe received his BA in geology and biology from Brown University. In addition to his teaching experience, Mr. Doughty is the father of two little girls, the Treasurer for the Maine Science Teachers Association, a fencing instructor, and a medieval re-enactor.  \\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun Fact: When in Madagascar, Mr. Doughty was at one point taught to sail a dugout canoe by a group of young people who were amazed at the color of his hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n    <div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"natdoug\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Nate Edmunds - Art & Design Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/natdoug.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:nate.edmunds@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">nate.edmunds@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMr. Edmunds arrives at Baxter fresh from the Peace Corps.

In 2005, he graduated with a BFA from the Maine College of Art, where he majored in New Media and minored in Art History. He has exhibited his work at Las Cruces Museum of Art, Mass MOCA, and The Black Factory National Tour.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Edmunds has personal reasons for wanting to come back to Maine to teach at Baxter: “When I entered 3rd grade, I had already completed the 3rd grade math book and wanted to start on the 4th.  The teacher didn’t allow it.  Parents struggled, talked it through with admin, wrestled with whether to home school, and gave up.  I stopped doing homework for 10 years and got by on high-test scores.  I chatted and wrote notes all through class, resented the institution, developed cynicism toward society in general, became opinionated and bitter by 17.  That kind of thing happens.  But it should happen less.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Edmunds: He is building an 18.3-foot cedar-strip kayak, working on a series of crochet sculptures, and writing a novel. He has the tenor saxophone leftover from his grandfather’s army days. And he has percussion training in Haitian and West African Conga.

Through a variety of collaborative projects, his students pose questions and seek solutions to challenges such as providing clean drinking water and food to the world’s growing population, dealing with the impact of wide-scale immigration in the developed world, revamping failed development strategies, providing economic and social justice to the world’s most disadvantaged populations, and maintaining a fair and equitable historical narrative in the age of big data and entertainment media.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Gilman says, “I have always been a firm believer in democratic learning and project-based inquiry, and I look forward to expanding these types of collaborative assignments into co-designed semester- or year-long projects at Baxter. The vision of Baxter Academy is not only one of collaborative learning, but of collaborative teaching as well, which is one of its most exciting features from my perspective. I can’t wait to start co-planning and co-teaching with my colleagues from across the disciplines.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Gilman has a B.A. in history and an M.A. in African Studies, both from UCLA.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Gilman: He’s been to thirty countries (and counting).

She earned her M.S. in Counseling at the University of Southern Maine and her B.A. in Theatre and Creative Writing at Hampshire College.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Medeiros was drawn to Baxter’s student-centered approach to learning: “I believe students learn the most when they feel a sense of ownership around their learning.  When students can identify their own interests and then find the support and resources they need to purse them, they are well on their way to creating the most challenging, engaging, and rewarding academic careers.  The skills they learn in doing this are essential outside of high school, as well, and become the foundation of lifelong learning and growth.  I\\'m delighted to be at Baxter and seeing that process play out for our students every day!“ \\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Medeiros has a strong knowledge of proficiency-based curriculum and presented her work at the Maine Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. Her experience includes work as a Civil Rights Team Leader and counselor for at risk students.  “Helping students in transition - whether into or out of high school, or in other moments of their lives - is a major part of being a school counselor and is something I love to do,” Ms. Medeiros says. “ I think young people are best served by helping them help themselves so they can develop the skills they need to enjoy and be successful in school, on the job, or anywhere in their lives.  I am constantly amazed by the unique strengths each student has, and am honored to be a part of helping them grow.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun Fact: Ms. Medeiros  is a playwright in her spare time, and enjoys having her plays produced and participating in the vibrant local theater community.

He began his career at Wells High School, initially teaching Chemistry and Geometry. His subsequent teaching assignments spread to most of the curriculum in math and physical science, eventually expanding into technology as well. It was also there that he experienced his first forays into the wilds of school reform. Since 2001 he has been a member of the Poland Regional High School faculty, where he was a co-creator of an interdisciplinary individualized team, a faculty coach and mentor, and a long-serving member of the PRHS governance group. He has taught a wide range of courses, including Astronomy, Chemistry, and Physics; Statistics, Integrated Math, and Calculus; Digital Photography, Desktop Publishing, and AP Programming.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nThe concept of learning by discovery is central to his idea of successful learning. As Mr. Rawson puts it: “Figuring out how things work – in which direction will that rolling ball move? what function describes this pattern? – is vital to understanding the world around us. Without that understanding, we can hardly expect to be more than spectators, rather than participants.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Rawson is a graduate of the University of Maine, where he earned double majors in Mathematics and Physics. There he met educators whose ideas he later turned loose in his own classrooms: math professors who taught the value of a Socratic dialogue and treating students as individuals; teacher guides who instilled the simple importance of commandeering a student’s pencil; physics professors who let students explore a room full of equipment with which to investigate the world, and showed how there is ample room and opportunity for humor in education. His work at the UMaine (now Maynard F Jordan) Planetarium also helped show him the path to a future helping students understand the universe around them.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nThe promise and the challenge afforded as one of the trailblazers making a path for the success of Baxter Academy, its students, its community, and its spirit, posed an opportunity too difficult to resist. The prospect of crafting effective individualized education around math and science is too thrilling to ignore. Helping the collective Baxter community figure out how to accomplish such a seemingly simple (yet inestimably complex) problem – now that is a noble quest!\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Rawson: Neither the piano nor the clarinet (or even, during a disastrous spring, the drums) has yet succumbed to his efforts at mastery – or, to be fair, even competency. Seeking an outlet for music has instead lead to years as a choral singer (Messiah singalong, anyone?) and to all sides of the stage apron, where he has performed in and directed community theatre productions, high school theatre, and assisted local theaters with their technical lighting needs. An avid writer, he is also the author of Murder on Mount Desert.\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"prawson\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Pamela Rawson - Mathematics Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/prawson.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:pam.rawson@baxter-academy.org \\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">pam.rawson@baxter-academy.org </button></a>\\r\\n           <a href=\\\"https://sites.google.com/a/baxter-academy.org/rawsonmath/home\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info pull-right\\\">Website</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMs. Rawson has been teaching for 25 years. During her career, Ms. Rawson has taught all levels of high school mathematics from basic skills to Advanced Placement. She spent the last twelve years at Poland Regional High School working with an integrated mathematics program and developing cross-curricular projects. While at Poland, Ms Rawson worked with teams of at-risk students, co-taught an integrated math/physics course with Mr. Rawson, served as a teacher leader and mentor, and field-tested the use of TI-Nspire technology for learning mathematics. She is intrigued by the use of technology to teach conceptual understanding and has used a variety of tools, beginning with graphing calculators in 1990.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nAs an independent consultant, Ms. Rawson has provided professional development to math teachers in Maine and throughout the country since 1993. Much of her recent work has focused on implementation of Core-Plus Mathematics and classroom use of TI-Nspire. She was recently granted T3 Regional Instructor status by Texas Instruments. Ms. Rawson is currently President of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics in Maine where she has worked to organize professional development supporting implementation of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs Rawson is a graduate of the University of Lowell and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics, with concentrations in Computer Science and Statistics. She also studied Mathematics at the graduate level for two years at the University of Maine.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs Rawson is excited to be a member of the Baxter inaugural faculty and looks forward to being amazed by her colleagues and students. She is especially excited to be returning to teach in Portland, where her career began.

For the past two years he’s been team-teaching honors courses at Maine Central Institute using a project- based model that integrates history and English.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nA strong interest in anthropology has led him to build projects around cultural artifacts that reveal something about the society that created it. In one project, he and his students worked on an ethnography of the United States in the 1950s using artifacts such as TV dinners and early video games.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Scogin says: “I see my job as a humanities teacher as one where I strive to create a balance between an open doorway to the outside world and a safe space where students can gain perspective on that world. From this vantage point, we gain the ability to see the interconnectedness of the human experience, especially how technology changes that experience. We can weigh technological advancement and the role it plays in changing our society. Science, technology, math, and engineering depend on the humanities just as much as the humanities depend on STEM subjects for further inspiration. My teaching asks the questions that binds these disparate subjects together and provides the context to move forward with whatever the human experience will be.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nAt MCI, Mr. Scogin advised the school’s faculty about using technology in the classroom and was a dorm parent to international students. He advised the Model United Nations and coached the soccer, cross country, and rifle teams.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Scogin: He spends at least one week a year alone in the backcountry and so he’s hiked almost all of the Appalachian Trail. He wants to paddle the Northern Forest Canoe Trail and would love to fly fish in Mongolia.  He is an amateur woodworker, a hobby diesel mechanic and grease-car conversion specialist, and an organic gardener.

He introduces his students to new technologies and techniques that are relevant to today’s creative economy and that has helped them make everything from carbon fiber skateboards and surfboard to hovercrafts and human-powered vehicles. He himself once designed a prototype bicycle for use in Antarctica, and the project won a National Creative Genius Award.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\n “After only a few minutes at Baxter Academy I could tell that Baxter was a place I could call home,” Mr. Stutzman says. “I grew up on a small vegetable farm in Sangerville, Maine.  There is a certain energy that surrounds the farm that I have also found at Baxter.  It is derived from the sense of community and the coordinated dedication found in both the staff and the student body.  Ideas are allowed space to grow and flourish.  Project-based learning allows both students and faculty to discover new subject matter in a manner that gives both relevance and purpose to the curriculum.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Stutzman has also coached the Science Olympiad and has served as assistant director in the drama department. In his free time, he surfs, hang glides, snowboards, and plays music.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nHe has a bachelors degree in Business/Economics from the University of Maine at Farmington, and an associates degree in specialized technology from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, where he majored in industrial design technology.

At Poland Regional High School, where she taught humanities for eleven years, she also designed the student judiciary board (the model for Baxter’s j-board). She proposed and designed an alternative school within the school that allowed students to work at their own pace while meeting the same standards as mainstream students. And she designed a standards-recovery program for students who didn’t meet course standards.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nAt Poland, she taught humanities integrated with math, science, and special education. She created an SAT prep curriculum that was embedded in her classes and also in an after-school prep course. She created a standards-based summer school. One of her specialties is implementing standards-based curriculum and assessment, and she has taught other teachers about standards-based education at UNE, Kaplan University, and USM (her alma mater for both a bachelors in history and a masters in education).\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Taylor says, “I am excited to teach at Baxter because I think embracing contradictions and loving ambiguity should be part of every school.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Taylor grew up in southern California and now lives with her family in Raymond, Maine.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Ms. Taylor:  She was in the Navy but gets seasick.

$k_stmts[] = $k_stmt_pre."(11, 8, 'historycontent', '', '', 'richtext', 0, 'text', 0, NULL, '\\r\\n    Baxter Academy was founded in response to a growing urgency among students and parents for greater access to high-quality STEM education. In the summer of 2012, a group of students, parents, educators, and community leaders united around the idea of a STEM-focused charter high school in Portland that would be open by lottery to any high school student in the state of Maine and would feature an innovative, project-based curriculum. A key feature of the school would be Flex Friday, a unique program designed to invest 20 percent of the week in yearlong student-driven projects solving real-world problems.  Baxter students would commute daily from a 25-mile catchment area to go to school in downtown Portland where they would be prepared for the best colleges and be plugged directly into the economic engine of the state through internships, mentorships, and industry partnerships. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the rigorous approval process, the community worked together to meet the requirements of Maine’s new charter law and the Maine Charter School Commission. Students raised \$8,000 in a 1,000 Pledges in 10 Days campaign. Parents organized information sessions at local libraries. Baxter’s Board of Directors hired Head of School Michele LaForge and Executive Director Carl Stasio and then signed the charter contract with the Charter Commission in May 2013. Mere months later, in September, the school opened its doors at 54 York Street to 125 freshmen and sophomore students from 28 towns. Working alongside the students was a diverse, talented, and highly experienced faculty of teachers committed to student-centered learning and innovation. At its first monitoring review, the Charter Commission stated that education at Baxter Academy was “as good as it gets.” Now in its third year, Baxter educates 320 freshmen through seniors from 66 towns and has added a digital-media-based satellite space on Congress Street. Its first graduation will be held in June 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents are fulfilling the promise of the idea that inspired a community to create Baxter Academy. This past year, 100% of Baxter students completed Flex Friday projects and presented at final exhibitions.  On the Smarter Balanced statewide assessment, 86% of Baxter juniors scored at or above standard in Problem-solving and Modeling & Data Analysis, compared with 65% at or above in the state as a whole. Baxter students are also succeeding with large-scale projects: The school’s community-based rookie FIRST robotics team went to World competition and came home the top-ranked team in Maine (working with a tiny build budget of only \$5,000) and the second highest ranked rookie team in the world. A group of freshmen and sophomores took first place in a statewide wind power competition against experienced upperclassmen. Writing in the Portland Press Herald, (April 5, 2015) economist Charles Lawton, said, “If, as Gallup research contends, entrepreneurship is basically about optimism, and if, as I believe, [Baxter Academy\\'s] Flex Friday is basically about entrepreneurship, then expanding this form of education will go a long way toward addressing Maine’s economic woes.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n Recently Maine’s Commissioner of Education lauded what he saw on a Flex Friday visit to Baxter, saying: “At other schools we may see students working with 3-D printers. At Baxter, students are building a 3-D printer.” The Commissioner, as well as members of the state legislature and city council, the state and regional Chambers of Commerce and state workforce-development leaders who have also visited, have talked about their concerns about identifying ways to educate students for the unpredictable world in five, ten, or fifteen years. For them, Baxter represents a promising model. At Baxter, students regularly approach open-ended problems on Flex Friday—and independently persevere through failure until they find creative solutions. This kind of problem solving prepares students to confront and to solve the emerging problems of the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaxter Academy has proven already to be a necessary option not only for its students, but for Maine as well. The school continues to seek STEM-industry partnerships and support that will extend its reach and its ability to prepare the next generation of highly skilled innovators who will help Maine meet the challenges of the 21st century.\\r\\n', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 80, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, '<cms:editable\\r\\nname=\\'historycontent\\'\\r\\ntype=\\'richtext\\'/>', '', NULL, 1);";

They are curious and motivated... You see where we’re going with this: We think it’s important that the adults in the school share the same wonderful traits as the students. The school’s executive director, Carl Stasio, brings wisdom and nearly three decades of leadership experience in Maine education. Head of School Michele LaForge brims over with creativity in designing the school around its unique mission—and she is nurturing and tough-minded, too. \\r\\nWhat’s different about Baxter Academy?\\r\\nBaxter Academy offers a well-rounded education with an emphasis on deeply engaging students in hands-on study of science, technology, engineering, and math. Baxter has a robust and lively humanities department, as well as Mandarin language taught by a native speaker. Electives in 2013-14 have included music ensemble, photography, CAD, JAVA, furniture building, creative writing, journalism, and graphic design. Students engage in projects of their own choosing, as well as school-wide explorations that knit together the disciplines. On Fridays, the students work on FLEX FRIDAY group projects of their design and implementation. Each project has a faculty advisor. This year, some of those include an underwater robot, a canoe, a mural, a radio station, high-speed photography, video games, a green roof for the school, and mobility footgear for a virtual-reality platform. Inquiry leads the learning at Baxter. Students think for themselves. They analyze. They innovate.

The Student Senate is composed of one senator from each of Baxter Academy’s advisory groups, a total of twenty-four. These senators are elected at the beginning of each year by the members of their respective advisories and, as such, serve as their representatives. The Student Senate has two faculty advisors; their role is to facilitate meetings and to disseminate information on those proceedings, including legislation, proposals, or memoranda, to the full faculty or the board. The Student Senate has served a variety of roles at Baxter, but its primary function has been the establishment and promotion of the school’s community norms. Early in the 2013-14 school year, with guidance from the faculty and student body, the Student Senate drafted and revised a school constitution. This constitution, known as the Baxtitution (see appendix 1), has been ratified by the faculty and currently serves as our official norms. Future amendments to the Baxtitution, should they become necessary, will be written by the Student Senate and ratified by the faculty. Any student accused of violating the norms enumerated in the Baxtitution is placed on our Behavior Step Ladder and, in most cases, is referred to our Student Judiciary Board, the judicial branch of student government. To carry out its legislative work, the Student Senate has taken on an advisory role. Senators report any issues brought to their attention by their constituents (i.e. fellow advisees) to the Senate. If the Senate determines that the issue is significant enough to weigh in on, it is handed off to one of the six subcommittees that have been formed to mirror and collaborate with the six standing faculty committees. A subcommittee can be tasked with drafting a policy memorandum or proposal to pass on to its partnering faculty committee. It can also be charged, by its partnering committee, to give feedback on a faculty proposal. The committees are as follows: Non-Formal Learning, School Culture, School Community, Community Connections, Operations and Facilities, and Academics. These partnerships give the student body a significant voice in policy formation and administration at Baxter Academy. \\r\\n\\r\\n', 0, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 80, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, '<cms:editable\\r\\nname=\\'senatecontent\\'\\r\\ntype=\\'richtext\\'/>', '', NULL, 1);";

While it is the responsibility of the Student Senate to inform the development of school norms and our Baxtitution, it is the responsibility of the Judiciary Board to hold members of our community accountable for violating the school norms as explained in the Baxtitution. As a result, students appearing before the Judiciary Board who are found guilty of violating school norms receive timely and appropriate consequences for their actions. It is important to note that all Judiciary Board proceedings are confidential. The Judiciary Board is composed entirely of students. There is a faculty advisor who facilitates the hearing protocol and interacts with the principal, student defendant, parents, and other faculty members as needed. The faculty advisor also keeps track of cases and evaluates the completed consequences assigned by the student board. A student who violates the Baxtitution may have a hearing before the Judiciary Board, or may choose to deal directly with administration. If the student chooses the hearing, then the Judiciary Board is convened. The charge is read and the student is given an opportunity to explain his or her actions. The student’s parents and advisor are invited to give any insight into why the student might have behaved in the manner being suggested. Throughout the hearing, the Jurors are allowed to ask questions. Once the hearing is completed, the Jurors vote on the guilt or innocence of the student defendant. If found guilty of the charge, the Jurors determine appropriate consequences. The goal is to help the student defendant learn from this mistake and change the behavior so that it is not repeated. For example, a student found guilty of sexual harassment might have to research the consequences of this behavior in the workplace, create a public service announcement of some kind (video, poster, radio spot), and write a reflection about what that student learned and how his or her behavior impacted the victim. This type of consequence is specific to the behavior and the student is more likely to learn than from a detention or a suspension.

None of these is possible within the constraints of a conventional school schedule. Flex Friday is designed to alleviate many of these issues. It provides large blocks of time for students to perform lengthy experiments, immerse themselves in project design or research, and, through error analysis, learn from failure. Because all students have the same time available, groups of students are able to coalesce around projects of common interest and work collaboratively without scheduling difficulties. The significant amount of time permits students to work through a rigorous autonomous open-ended project development process, reaching beyond textbooks or previous learning to access the necessary information. Teachers, freed from other teaching obligations, are able to focus on advising students as they work through their projects, assisting with skill development and making sure they ask the right questions, follow through on their work plans and collaborate effectively within work groups. The blocks of time facilitate the development of web-based research skills and the ability to work with collaborating businesses and other institutions. While the nature of student projects varies, the underlying lessons are the same. Some students may choose to work in a large group to develop an experimental model for a fish hatchery, others may want to work individually on a writing a database program with a local company. In both cases students must work through prescribed procedures. Both cases require students to define the project objectives, be responsible for time, budget, and project management, and to devise iterative creative solutions to a given problem. In most cases, projects give back to the community. Flex Friday fosters the skills needed to succeed in the real world; these skills require time, responsibility, and creativity; and they are found outside of the standard high school curriculum. A student’s Flex Friday project begins with an idea. Finding student collaborators, and working with a teacher, students prepare a formal proposal describing the project details. Schedules, finances, outcomes, and connections to learning are all integral parts of that proposal. Once completed, the proposal is submitted for approval (or revision), and then the project and the project team is off and running.

These senators are elected at the beginning of each year by the members of their respective advisories and, as such, serve as their representatives. The Student Senate has two faculty advisors; their role is to facilitate meetings and to disseminate information on those proceedings, including legislation, proposals, or memoranda, to the full faculty or the board. The Student Senate has served a variety of roles at Baxter, but its primary function has been the establishment and promotion of the school’s community norms. Early in the 2013-14 school year, with guidance from the faculty and student body, the Student Senate drafted and revised a school constitution. This constitution, known as the Baxtitution (see appendix 1), has been ratified by the faculty and currently serves as our official norms. Future amendments to the Baxtitution, should they become necessary, will be written by the Student Senate and ratified by the faculty. Any student accused of violating the norms enumerated in the Baxtitution is placed on our Behavior Step Ladder and, in most cases, is referred to our Student Judiciary Board, the judicial branch of student government. To carry out its legislative work, the Student Senate has taken on an advisory role. Senators report any issues brought to their attention by their constituents (i.e. fellow advisees) to the Senate. If the Senate determines that the issue is significant enough to weigh in on, it is handed off to one of the six subcommittees that have been formed to mirror and collaborate with the six standing faculty committees. A subcommittee can be tasked with drafting a policy memorandum or proposal to pass on to its partnering faculty committee. It can also be charged, by its partnering committee, to give feedback on a faculty proposal. The committees are as follows: Non-Formal Learning, School Culture, School Community, Community Connections, Operations and Facilities, and Academics. These partnerships give the student body a significant voice in policy formation and administration at Baxter Academy. \\r\\n\\r\\n', 0, 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 80, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, '<cms:editable\\r\\nname=\\'senatecontent\\'\\r\\ntype=\\'richtext\\'/>', '', NULL, 1);";

While it is the responsibility of the Student Senate to inform the development of school norms and our Baxtitution, it is the responsibility of the Judiciary Board to hold members of our community accountable for violating the school norms as explained in the Baxtitution. As a result, students appearing before the Judiciary Board who are found guilty of violating school norms receive timely and appropriate consequences for their actions. It is important to note that all Judiciary Board proceedings are confidential. The Judiciary Board is composed entirely of students. There is a faculty advisor who facilitates the hearing protocol and interacts with the principal, student defendant, parents, and other faculty members as needed. The faculty advisor also keeps track of cases and evaluates the completed consequences assigned by the student board. A student who violates the Baxtitution may have a hearing before the Judiciary Board, or may choose to deal directly with administration. If the student chooses the hearing, then the Judiciary Board is convened. The charge is read and the student is given an opportunity to explain his or her actions. The student’s parents and advisor are invited to give any insight into why the student might have behaved in the manner being suggested. Throughout the hearing, the Jurors are allowed to ask questions. Once the hearing is completed, the Jurors vote on the guilt or innocence of the student defendant. If found guilty of the charge, the Jurors determine appropriate consequences. The goal is to help the student defendant learn from this mistake and change the behavior so that it is not repeated. For example, a student found guilty of sexual harassment might have to research the consequences of this behavior in the workplace, create a public service announcement of some kind (video, poster, radio spot), and write a reflection about what that student learned and how his or her behavior impacted the victim. This type of consequence is specific to the behavior and the student is more likely to learn than from a detention or a suspension. In some extreme cases, administration may need to take swift and clear action to insure student safety. Those are not cases for the Judiciary Board.\\r\\n', 0, 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 80, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, '<cms:editable\\r\\nname=\\'jboardcontent\\'\\r\\ntype=\\'richtext\\'/>', '', NULL, 1);";

None of these is possible within the constraints of a conventional school schedule. Flex Friday is designed to alleviate many of these issues. It provides large blocks of time for students to perform lengthy experiments, immerse themselves in project design or research, and, through error analysis, learn from failure. Because all students have the same time available, groups of students are able to coalesce around projects of common interest and work collaboratively without scheduling difficulties. The significant amount of time permits students to work through a rigorous autonomous open-ended project development process, reaching beyond textbooks or previous learning to access the necessary information. Teachers, freed from other teaching obligations, are able to focus on advising students as they work through their projects, assisting with skill development and making sure they ask the right questions, follow through on their work plans and collaborate effectively within work groups. The blocks of time facilitate the development of web-based research skills and the ability to work with collaborating businesses and other institutions. While the nature of student projects varies, the underlying lessons are the same. Some students may choose to work in a large group to develop an experimental model for a fish hatchery, others may want to work individually on a writing a database program with a local company. In both cases students must work through prescribed procedures. Both cases require students to define the project objectives, be responsible for time, budget, and project management, and to devise iterative creative solutions to a given problem. In most cases, projects give back to the community. Flex Friday fosters the skills needed to succeed in the real world; these skills require time, responsibility, and creativity; and they are found outside of the standard high school curriculum. A student’s Flex Friday project begins with an idea. Finding student collaborators, and working with a teacher, students prepare a formal proposal describing the project details. Schedules, finances, outcomes, and connections to learning are all integral parts of that proposal. Once completed, the proposal is submitted for approval (or revision), and then the project and the project team is off and running. All students participate in a culminating, public Project Presentation at the end of the year.\\r\\n', 0, 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 0, '', 0, '', 0, 0, 80, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 0, '<cms:editable\\r\\nname=\\'flexfriday\\'\\r\\ntype=\\'richtext\\'/>', '', NULL, 1);";

He had always been interested in education and had been helping students in local schools with their engineering projects. Working with kids, he began to realize that the skills that made him a successful engineer were not the skills he had learned in high school or that he saw being taught in high schools.  This realization moved him to teach. And he has now been teaching engineering for four years in Freeport (one year in middle school, three in high school). He has focused on building skills through large-scale, student-led, real world projects, such as a wind tunnel that clocked the highest wind speeds ever recorded in Maine.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Amory also has a background in naval architecture and philosophy, which he studied along with engineering at Trinity College. He has a master’s degree in design studies from Harvard University. He accomplished all this after struggling as a younger student, an experience he is quick to share with his students: “I am extremely dyslexic and could not read until I was in 7th grade.” He believes every student can be taught creativity and every student can succeed.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Amory worked to design Baxter Academy’s unique Flex Friday program. Mr. Amory grew up in Portland, attending Waynflete. He lives here with his family.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Amory:  He has sailed to Norway. He has climbed mountains on every continent except South America and Antarctica. He is an outlier when it comes to math and music: “I butcher every instrument I touch, but I can press play on a CD play, iPod and cassette deck.\\\"\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"mbarnes\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Matthew Barnes - Art & Design Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/mbarnes.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:matthew.barnes@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">matthew.barnes@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMr. Barnes’s personal motto is: “He who dies with the most tools wins.” He uses his tools to hand-carve slate tombstones, to motorize toy airplanes, to add micro-cameras to Estes rockets, and to repurpose 1950s rotary phones into his home’s intercom system. He knows how to cast metal, solder wire, and weld sheet steel. He can run a lathe and drill through glass and design a textbook. (Want to see more of what he can do? Go to mattmakes.weebly.com.)\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Barnes has a bachelor’s degree in education from Notre Dame College in Manchester, N.H., and also started a successful company that designed and manufactured tiles. His most important work recently, though, has been staying home on Peaks Island with his two small children.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nBaxter has brought him back to the mainland and to the classroom.  He remembers his first visit to the school: “People were excited to be there. They WANTED to be there and it showed in everything I saw. Students helped students in unselfish, uncritical ways and supported one another. Teachers were part of their classes and waded directly into whatever was going on rather than hovering on the edges. The mantra of \\\"Let\\'s try it\\\" elevated everything happening at Baxter and for me, it was like Dorothy stepping into the colored world of Oz. I spent a long time thinking, ‘This can\\'t be actually happening,’ but it is, and I can\\'t wait to start.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Barnes: He’s a pilot, a scuba diver, and the cemetery keeper for Brackett Memorial Cemetery on Peaks. He can write with either hand and walk across the bottom of a pond. Ticks freak him out. He loves the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series and can quote anything from Monty Python (but please don’t ask him to do that in front of his family because it embarrasses them).\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"sbuhlman\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Sarah Buhlman - Instructional Specialist</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/sbuhlman.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:sarah.buhlman@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">sarah.buhlman@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMs. Buhlman comes to the Baxter adventure from a life of adventure. She grew up on a Maryland horse farm, played rugby, and spent a college semester sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii with the Sea Education Association. She fell in love with teaching while sailing on a 74-foot schooner out of Annapolis, Maryland, and she’s since been an outdoor educator in Alaska and Maine, where she spends her summers as an sailing, canoeing, and backpacking instructor for Hurricane Island Outward Bound School in Rockland. She’s spent the last two years as an AmeriCorps volunteer specializing in adventure education.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nShe has a Bachelor of Science degree in biology (botany and ecology track) from Towson University.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Buhlman worked at the REAL School on Mackworth Island last year but wanted to establish a longer lasting relationship with a Maine school. “After spending only a day with the Baxter students and staff, I could see this was the type of school I could make a home in: Someplace where the students are valued as people and not just as a number that takes a test. Where the staff is encouraged to be creative and inspire the students to discover their love of learning.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Ms. Buhlman: She once had a job preparing three meals a day for 100 campers and staff at Camp Dark Waters. She attended a Quaker high school. She works two nights a week at Trader Joe’s, and if she’s not working, she’s over at Back Cove Crossift picking up heavy things and putting them back down again at varying rates of intensity. Sailing on the schooner Woodwind, she and her fellow sailors came in second in the Great Chesapeake Bay Schooner Race. Her friends call her eSBee.\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"hdippolito\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Heather D\\'Ippolito - Humanities Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/hdippolito.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:heather.dippolito@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">heather.dippolito@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMs. D’Ippolito is a fifth-generation Mainer who last year returned home after a long stint teaching in New York City—five years in Brooklyn and three in the Bronx. At the Bushwick School for Social Justice, she was a tenth-grade English teacher who used project-based learning to explore texts ranging from Persepolis to Senegalese poetry to news articles on how social media played a role in the Egyptian revolution.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nHer work wasn’t confined to the classroom in Brooklyn. She developed and implemented programs to help struggling students while aligning their work with the Common Core Learning Standards. She worked on a team to develop the school’s standards-based grading policy. She served as a coordinator for student affairs and helped plan college tours and job fairs, as well as workshops on social justice issues.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMost recently she has been the Jobs for Maine’s Graduates teacher at Bonny Eagle High School. Led by student interest, she has guided service projects with local elementary schools, the Ronald McDonald House, and USM Enactus Club.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nShe holds a bachelor of arts in English literature with a focus on environmental literature from Saint Michael’s College in Vermont, and she also studied at the School for International Training in Jaipur, India. She has a master of science in education from Herbert H. Lehman College in New York.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nWhy does she want to be part of Baxter? “This is a great time to call Portland home. The city\\'s landscape and its community members create an ideal setting and cast of characters for the kinds of collaborative work students and staff are creating at Baxter. I feel very fortunate to be involved in education right now!”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Ms. D’Ippolito:  If she weren’t a teacher, she’d probably be a pastry chef. (Her favorite iced treat she’s made to date: vanilla bean ice cream pie with raspberry compote and fudge swirl...in a graham cracker crust.) She has knitted since high school and recently started avidly watching birds.\\r\\n\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"jdoughty\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Jonathan Doughty - Science Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/jdoughty.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:jonathan.doughty@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">jonathan.doughty@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMr. Doughty has been a science teacher for 12 years, teaching at both a private middle school and several public high schools in Maine. He is teaching science at Baxter. He has taught a wide range of physical and life science classes including physics, geology, chemistry, and biology. Mr. Doughty believes “that good science education--like good science--starts with inquiry, travels through data and analysis, and reaches conclusions that lead inevitably to new questions.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nHe received his BA in geology and biology from Brown University. In addition to his teaching experience, Mr. Doughty is the father of two little girls, the Treasurer for the Maine Science Teachers Association, a fencing instructor, and a medieval re-enactor.  \\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun Fact: When in Madagascar, Mr. Doughty was at one point taught to sail a dugout canoe by a group of young people who were amazed at the color of his hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n    <div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"natdoug\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Nate Edmunds - Art & Design Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/natdoug.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:nate.edmunds@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">nate.edmunds@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMr. Edmunds arrives at Baxter fresh from the Peace Corps. He spent two years in Ukraine teaching English at a local high school, mentoring students in creative writing, and organizing youth leadership events. He has also taught in Tokyo and Jerusalem. In 2005, he graduated with a BFA from the Maine College of Art, where he majored in New Media and minored in Art History. He has exhibited his work at Las Cruces Museum of Art, Mass MOCA, and The Black Factory National Tour.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Edmunds has personal reasons for wanting to come back to Maine to teach at Baxter: “When I entered 3rd grade, I had already completed the 3rd grade math book and wanted to start on the 4th.  The teacher didn’t allow it.  Parents struggled, talked it through with admin, wrestled with whether to home school, and gave up.  I stopped doing homework for 10 years and got by on high-test scores.  I chatted and wrote notes all through class, resented the institution, developed cynicism toward society in general, became opinionated and bitter by 17.  That kind of thing happens.  But it should happen less.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Edmunds: He is building an 18.3-foot cedar-strip kayak, working on a series of crochet sculptures, and writing a novel.

Through a variety of collaborative projects, his students pose questions and seek solutions to challenges such as providing clean drinking water and food to the world’s growing population, dealing with the impact of wide-scale immigration in the developed world, revamping failed development strategies, providing economic and social justice to the world’s most disadvantaged populations, and maintaining a fair and equitable historical narrative in the age of big data and entertainment media.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Gilman says, “I have always been a firm believer in democratic learning and project-based inquiry, and I look forward to expanding these types of collaborative assignments into co-designed semester- or year-long projects at Baxter. The vision of Baxter Academy is not only one of collaborative learning, but of collaborative teaching as well, which is one of its most exciting features from my perspective. I can’t wait to start co-planning and co-teaching with my colleagues from across the disciplines.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Gilman has a B.A. in history and an M.A. in African Studies, both from UCLA.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Gilman: He’s been to thirty countries (and counting).

When students can identify their own interests and then find the support and resources they need to purse them, they are well on their way to creating the most challenging, engaging, and rewarding academic careers.  The skills they learn in doing this are essential outside of high school, as well, and become the foundation of lifelong learning and growth.  I\\'m delighted to be at Baxter and seeing that process play out for our students every day!“ \\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Medeiros has a strong knowledge of proficiency-based curriculum and presented her work at the Maine Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. Her experience includes work as a Civil Rights Team Leader and counselor for at risk students.  “Helping students in transition - whether into or out of high school, or in other moments of their lives - is a major part of being a school counselor and is something I love to do,” Ms. Medeiros says. “ I think young people are best served by helping them help themselves so they can develop the skills they need to enjoy and be successful in school, on the job, or anywhere in their lives.  I am constantly amazed by the unique strengths each student has, and am honored to be a part of helping them grow.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun Fact: Ms. Medeiros  is a playwright in her spare time, and enjoys having her plays produced and participating in the vibrant local theater community.

In addition, he served as a mathematics tutor for undergraduate students at all levels from pre-algebra to multivariate calculus. \\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Parrott-Wolfe says,  “I believe  mathematics is an art and that investigations in mathematics stem from creativity and curiosity. Mathematics isn’t always about getting the right answer, but about the ongoing process of problem-solving.” Mr. Parrott-Wolfe wants his classroom always to be inquiry-led and expects hand-on-involvement from his students. \\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts:  Mr. Parrott-Wolfe has been a barista, paperboy, audio engineer, welder, recycling plant sorter, baker, bike mechanic, and a dockhand.\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"eperks\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Elke Perks - Life Sciences Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/eperks.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:elke.perks@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">elke.perks@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMs. Perks doesn’t just teach about the dirt; she gets out there with students into the dirt—or water. As a life science teacher, most recently at South Portland, and as a English major at Rutgers, she loves connecting things—the fall of Mayan civilization because of anomalies in climate patterns and how those climate trends might mean something now; or the history of Aztecs and chocolate and why it might inform thinking about contemporary water issues. Side-by-side with her students, she discovers meaningful stories through science.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\n“The world to me is a fluid system that connects everything in a complex community of interactions encompassing all disciplines,” says Ms. Perks. “The more I teach, the more connections I can see, and it inspires me to want to learn more.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Perks has a masters in environmental studies from Antioch New England and has taught in experiential programs at the Stone Environmental Schools of New England and as an adventure educator at Camp Kieve, where she led ten-day wilderness sea kayaking and backpacking trips for freshmen and sophomore girls.

He began his career at Wells High School, initially teaching Chemistry and Geometry. His subsequent teaching assignments spread to most of the curriculum in math and physical science, eventually expanding into technology as well. It was also there that he experienced his first forays into the wilds of school reform. Since 2001 he has been a member of the Poland Regional High School faculty, where he was a co-creator of an interdisciplinary individualized team, a faculty coach and mentor, and a long-serving member of the PRHS governance group. He has taught a wide range of courses, including Astronomy, Chemistry, and Physics; Statistics, Integrated Math, and Calculus; Digital Photography, Desktop Publishing, and AP Programming.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nThe concept of learning by discovery is central to his idea of successful learning. As Mr. Rawson puts it: “Figuring out how things work – in which direction will that rolling ball move? what function describes this pattern? – is vital to understanding the world around us. Without that understanding, we can hardly expect to be more than spectators, rather than participants.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Rawson is a graduate of the University of Maine, where he earned double majors in Mathematics and Physics. There he met educators whose ideas he later turned loose in his own classrooms: math professors who taught the value of a Socratic dialogue and treating students as individuals; teacher guides who instilled the simple importance of commandeering a student’s pencil; physics professors who let students explore a room full of equipment with which to investigate the world, and showed how there is ample room and opportunity for humor in education. His work at the UMaine (now Maynard F Jordan) Planetarium also helped show him the path to a future helping students understand the universe around them.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nThe promise and the challenge afforded as one of the trailblazers making a path for the success of Baxter Academy, its students, its community, and its spirit, posed an opportunity too difficult to resist. The prospect of crafting effective individualized education around math and science is too thrilling to ignore. Helping the collective Baxter community figure out how to accomplish such a seemingly simple (yet inestimably complex) problem – now that is a noble quest!\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Rawson: Neither the piano nor the clarinet (or even, during a disastrous spring, the drums) has yet succumbed to his efforts at mastery – or, to be fair, even competency. Seeking an outlet for music has instead lead to years as a choral singer (Messiah singalong, anyone?) and to all sides of the stage apron, where he has performed in and directed community theatre productions, high school theatre, and assisted local theaters with their technical lighting needs. An avid writer, he is also the author of Murder on Mount Desert.\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"prawson\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Pamela Rawson - Mathematics Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/prawson.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:pam.rawson@baxter-academy.org \\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">pam.rawson@baxter-academy.org </button></a>\\r\\n           <a href=\\\"https://sites.google.com/a/baxter-academy.org/rawsonmath/home\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info pull-right\\\">Website</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMs. Rawson has been teaching for 25 years. During her career, Ms. Rawson has taught all levels of high school mathematics from basic skills to Advanced Placement. She spent the last twelve years at Poland Regional High School working with an integrated mathematics program and developing cross-curricular projects. While at Poland, Ms Rawson worked with teams of at-risk students, co-taught an integrated math/physics course with Mr. Rawson, served as a teacher leader and mentor, and field-tested the use of TI-Nspire technology for learning mathematics. She is intrigued by the use of technology to teach conceptual understanding and has used a variety of tools, beginning with graphing calculators in 1990.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nAs an independent consultant, Ms. Rawson has provided professional development to math teachers in Maine and throughout the country since 1993. Much of her recent work has focused on implementation of Core-Plus Mathematics and classroom use of TI-Nspire. She was recently granted T3 Regional Instructor status by Texas Instruments. Ms. Rawson is currently President of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics in Maine where she has worked to organize professional development supporting implementation of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs Rawson is a graduate of the University of Lowell and has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics, with concentrations in Computer Science and Statistics. She also studied Mathematics at the graduate level for two years at the University of Maine.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs Rawson is excited to be a member of the Baxter inaugural faculty and looks forward to being amazed by her colleagues and students. She is especially excited to be returning to teach in Portland, where her career began. In her first year of teaching at Portland High School, she teamed her geometry class with an art class to create an architecture unit, culminating with a walking tour of downtown Portland.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Ms Rawson: She plays many instruments, but none of them very well. She has a passion for musical theater and has been on stage and behind the scenes at many community theaters in southern Maine. She has spent the last decade tracing her family roots and has made some interesting discoveries.\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"brosenbloom\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Ben Rosenbloom</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/brosenbloom.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:ben.rosenbloom@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">ben.rosenbloom@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nBio Coming Soon!\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"dschwarz\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Donna Schwarz - Front Office Administrative Assistant</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/dschwarz.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:donna.schwarz@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">donna.schwarz@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nBio Coming Soon!\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"scogin\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Samuel Scogin - Humanities Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/scogin.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:sam.scogin@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">sam.scogin@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMr. Scogin has a bachelor’s degree in American studies and literature from Marlboro College and a master’s in education from Goddard College. For the past two years he’s been team-teaching honors courses at Maine Central Institute using a project- based model that integrates history and English.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nA strong interest in anthropology has led him to build projects around cultural artifacts that reveal something about the society that created it. In one project, he and his students worked on an ethnography of the United States in the 1950s using artifacts such as TV dinners and early video games.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Scogin says: “I see my job as a humanities teacher as one where I strive to create a balance between an open doorway to the outside world and a safe space where students can gain perspective on that world. From this vantage point, we gain the ability to see the interconnectedness of the human experience, especially how technology changes that experience. We can weigh technological advancement and the role it plays in changing our society. Science, technology, math, and engineering depend on the humanities just as much as the humanities depend on STEM subjects for further inspiration. My teaching asks the questions that binds these disparate subjects together and provides the context to move forward with whatever the human experience will be.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nAt MCI, Mr. Scogin advised the school’s faculty about using technology in the classroom and was a dorm parent to international students. He advised the Model United Nations and coached the soccer, cross country, and rifle teams.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Scogin: He spends at least one week a year alone in the backcountry and so he’s hiked almost all of the Appalachian Trail. He wants to paddle the Northern Forest Canoe Trail and would love to fly fish in Mongolia.

While at Boston Prep, she advised the student mentoring club, partnered with WriteBoston to improve student composition, got 30  seconds of playing time in the student vs staff basketball game, and served as the 9th grade Grade Level leader.  She is teaching ninth-grade Humanities this year at Baxter.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Starr  graduated from Colby College with a B.A. in English and Education, and received a Masters in Effective Teaching from the Charles Sposato Graduate School of Education. Prior to receiving her Masters, Ms. Starr worked at a middle school in inner-city Boston as a Teacher resident in the Match Teachers\\' Residency program. While, at Colby, Ms. Starr was a peer writing tutor at the  Farnham Writers’ Center and a mentor and program coordinator for Colby Cares about Kids.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Starr  is excited to learn from her students and co-workers at Baxter.

He introduces his students to new technologies and techniques that are relevant to today’s creative economy and that has helped them make everything from carbon fiber skateboards and surfboard to hovercrafts and human-powered vehicles. He himself once designed a prototype bicycle for use in Antarctica, and the project won a National Creative Genius Award.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\n “After only a few minutes at Baxter Academy I could tell that Baxter was a place I could call home,” Mr. Stutzman says. “I grew up on a small vegetable farm in Sangerville, Maine.  There is a certain energy that surrounds the farm that I have also found at Baxter.  It is derived from the sense of community and the coordinated dedication found in both the staff and the student body.  Ideas are allowed space to grow and flourish.  Project-based learning allows both students and faculty to discover new subject matter in a manner that gives both relevance and purpose to the curriculum.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMr. Stutzman has also coached the Science Olympiad and has served as assistant director in the drama department. In his free time, he surfs, hang glides, snowboards, and plays music.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nHe has a bachelors degree in Business/Economics from the University of Maine at Farmington, and an associates degree in specialized technology from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, where he majored in industrial design technology. He’s done industrial design for L.L. Bean, Maine Discovery Museum, and Moosehead Manufacturing, among others.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Mr. Stutzman: He surfs year-round in Maine’s coastal waters. He’s been a professional musician since age 11 and plays the saxophone, upright bass, harmonica, guitar, cello, fiddle, didgeridoo. Plus he sings. He gained important experience maintaining small engines through his hobby of hang gliding—using a harness outfitted with a small two-stroke high-performance engine attached to a folding propeller.\\r\\n		</p>\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n     </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"panel panel-default\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%\\\">\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-heading\\\">\\r\\n     <h1 id=\\\"ataylor\\\" class=\\\"panel-title\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center\\\">Angela Taylor - Humanities Teacher</h1>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n   <div class=\\\"panel-body\\\">\\r\\n     <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-3\\\">\\r\\n         <img src=\\\"images/faculty/ataylor.jpg\\\" class=\\\"img-responsive img-circle\\\" style=\\\"width: 250px; height: auto; margin-top:40px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\\\">\\r\\n       </div>\\r\\n       <div class=\\\"col-md-9\\\">\\r\\n         <a href=\\\"mailto:angela.taylor@baxter-academy.org\\\" target=\\\"_top\\\"><button type=\\\"button\\\" class=\\\"btn btn-info\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left\\\">angela.taylor@baxter-academy.org</button></a>\\r\\n         <p>\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\nMs. Taylor comes to Baxter as not just an experienced high-school teacher and elementary principal but as a designer of new approaches to education. At Poland Regional High School, where she taught humanities for eleven years, she also designed the student judiciary board (the model for Baxter’s j-board). She proposed and designed an alternative school within the school that allowed students to work at their own pace while meeting the same standards as mainstream students. And she designed a standards-recovery program for students who didn’t meet course standards.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nAt Poland, she taught humanities integrated with math, science, and special education. She created an SAT prep curriculum that was embedded in her classes and also in an after-school prep course. She created a standards-based summer school. One of her specialties is implementing standards-based curriculum and assessment, and she has taught other teachers about standards-based education at UNE, Kaplan University, and USM (her alma mater for both a bachelors in history and a masters in education).\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Taylor says, “I am excited to teach at Baxter because I think embracing contradictions and loving ambiguity should be part of every school.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Taylor grew up in southern California and now lives with her family in Raymond, Maine.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Ms. Taylor:  She was in the Navy but gets seasick.

Until 2009, she was head of the English department at the Bushwick School for Social Justice in Brooklyn, New York, where she used creative writing, role-playing, and close relationships to provide unique learning opportunities—even for students who often spoke English as a second language. She received the Most Dedicated Teacher and the Most Creative Teacher awards while there.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMost recently, she has empowered incarcerated youth at Long Creek Youth Development Center to express themselves through murals, poetry slams, community gardens, and a school newspaper. She has volunteered her time and talent to The Telling Room and Blunt Youth Radio.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nShe has an undergraduate degree from Radford University, and an MS in Education from Queens College, Queens, New York.  Between degrees, she lived in Bangkok, Thailand for two years, teaching at The American School of Bangkok and mentoring youth through arts and athletics programs.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nAs an English teacher, Ms. Virmalo’s goals are to strengthen communication skills—reading, writing, listening, and speaking—that will apply to any path her students choose.  She facilitates critical thinking. Her favorite part of high school English is celebrating student work with literary publications.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nMs. Virmalo says, “I am thrilled to be a member of Baxter Academy where talented educators collaborate with students, parents, and the community to build a school where learning is innovative, meaningful, and relevant to our ever- evolving world.  My work with diverse populations, from at-risk youth to international students, has demonstrated that everyone learns differently. Baxter Academy is a school where all learners will be challenged and engaged.”\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\nFun facts about Ms. Virmalo: She is a traveler, reader, baker, seamstress, yogi, and mother.  She has taken class with the Croatian National Ballet and walked the Great Wall.

What’s the faculty like? Baxter faculty are innovative and ethical. They are curious and motivated. They are willing to take risks, to fail, and to reflect in order to learn. They are inclusive of others. They take personal responsibility but are geared towards collaboration. As a group, they have taught all over the United States and Ukraine and China. Together, they speak many languages and play many musical instruments. Some are from Maine. Some are from away. One has built robots on US military contracts and another has built kayaks from cedar strips. One has a degree in particle physics but also experiments with photographic techniques from the Civil War. One teaches chemistry and writes murder mysteries. Every one of them is attentive, responsive, and caring. And they are still learning. Every day. What about the administration? Baxter’s administrative staff are innovative and ethical. They are curious and motivated... You see where we’re going with this: We think it’s important that the adults in the school share the same wonderful traits as the students. The school’s executive director, Carl Stasio, brings wisdom and nearly three decades of leadership experience in Maine education. Head of School Michele LaForge brims over with creativity in designing the school around its unique mission—and she is nurturing and tough-minded, too. What’s different about Baxter Academy? Baxter Academy offers a well-rounded education with an emphasis on deeply engaging students in hands-on study of science, technology, engineering, and math. Baxter has a robust and lively humanities department, as well as Mandarin language taught by a native speaker. Electives in 2013-14 have included music ensemble, photography, CAD, JAVA, furniture building, creative writing, journalism, and graphic design. Students engage in projects of their own choosing, as well as school-wide explorations that knit together the disciplines. On Fridays, the students work on FLEX FRIDAY group projects of their design and implementation. Each project has a faculty advisor. This year, some of those include an underwater robot, a canoe, a mural, a radio station, high-speed photography, video games, a green roof for the school, and mobility footgear for a virtual-reality platform. Inquiry leads the learning at Baxter. Students think for themselves. They analyze. They innovate. Busy work doesn’t happen here, but everyone is always busy with meaningful, exciting work. Can my child attend Baxter Academy? If your child is a Maine resident rising into the ninth tenth, or eleventh grade, he or she is eligible to enroll at Baxter. How do I enroll my student?

$k_stmts[] = $k_stmt_pre."(8, 'Default page for history.php * PLEASE CHANGE THIS TITLE *', '     Baxter Academy was founded in response to a growing urgency among students and parents for greater access to high-quality STEM education. In the summer of 2012, a group of students, parents, educators, and community leaders united around the idea of a STEM-focused charter high school in Portland that would be open by lottery to any high school student in the state of Maine and would feature an innovative, project-based curriculum. A key feature of the school would be Flex Friday, a unique program designed to invest 20 percent of the week in yearlong student-driven projects solving real-world problems. Baxter students would commute daily from a 25-mile catchment area to go to school in downtown Portland where they would be prepared for the best colleges and be plugged directly into the economic engine of the state through internships, mentorships, and industry partnerships.      During the rigorous approval process, the community worked together to meet the requirements of Maine’s new charter law and the Maine Charter School Commission. Students raised \$8,000 in a 1,000 Pledges in 10 Days campaign. Parents organized information sessions at local libraries. Baxter’s Board of Directors hired Head of School Michele LaForge and Executive Director Carl Stasio and then signed the charter contract with the Charter Commission in May 2013. Mere months later, in September, the school opened its doors at 54 York Street to 125 freshmen and sophomore students from 28 towns. Working alongside the students was a diverse, talented, and highly experienced faculty of teachers committed to student-centered learning and innovation. At its first monitoring review, the Charter Commission stated that education at Baxter Academy was “as good as it gets.” Now in its third year, Baxter educates 320 freshmen through seniors from 66 towns and has added a digital-media-based satellite space on Congress Street. Its first graduation will be held in June 2016.      Students are fulfilling the promise of the idea that inspired a community to create Baxter Academy. This past year, 100% of Baxter students completed Flex Friday projects and presented at final exhibitions. On the Smarter Balanced statewide assessment, 86% of Baxter juniors scored at or above standard in Problem-solving and Modeling &amp; Data Analysis, compared with 65% at or above in the state as a whole. Baxter students are also succeeding with large-scale projects: The school’s community-based rookie FIRST robotics team went to World competition and came home the top-ranked team in Maine (working with a tiny build budget of only \$5,000) and the second highest ranked rookie team in the world. A group of freshmen and sophomores took first place in a statewide wind power competition against experienced upperclassmen. Writing in the Portland Press Herald, (April 5, 2015) economist Charles Lawton, said, “If, as Gallup research contends, entrepreneurship is basically about optimism, and if, as I believe, [Baxter Academy&#039;s] Flex Friday is basically about entrepreneurship, then expanding this form of education will go a long way toward addressing Maine’s economic woes.&quot;      Recently Maine’s Commissioner of Education lauded what he saw on a Flex Friday visit to Baxter, saying: “At other schools we may see students working with 3-D printers. At Baxter, students are building a 3-D printer.” The Commissioner, as well as members of the state legislature and city council, the state and regional Chambers of Commerce and state workforce-development leaders who have also visited, have talked about their concerns about identifying ways to educate students for the unpredictable world in five, ten, or fifteen years. For them, Baxter represents a promising model. At Baxter, students regularly approach open-ended problems on Flex Friday—and independently persevere through failure until they find creative solutions. This kind of problem solving prepares students to confront and to solve the emerging problems of the future.      Baxter Academy has proven already to be a necessary option not only for its students, but for Maine as well. The school continues to seek STEM-industry partnerships and support that will extend its reach and its ability to prepare the next generation of highly skilled innovators who will help Maine meet the challenges of the 21st century. Inquiry leads learning at Baxter Academy for Technology and Science, a public charter high school free to Maine students. Our project-based STEM curriculum emphasizes real-world problem solving and is paired with a humanities program that connects ideas across disciplines and cultivates strong communication skills. Students design innovative projects through Flex Friday, a unique program requiring initiative, perseverance, and collaboration, as well as reflection on the work and its impact in the community. Our students choose work that inspires their imaginations. They persevere through setbacks and innovate with curiosity, conscience, and creativity. They solve real-world problems. Our students matter not only to their school but also to a strong future for Maine. ');";

$k_stmts[] = $k_stmt_pre."(10, 'Default page for studentgov.php * PLEASE CHANGE THIS TITLE *', '     The Student Senate serves as the legislative branch of student government at Baxter Academy and ensures that students have a voice in creating and evaluating school policy. The Student Senate is composed of one senator from each of Baxter Academy’s advisory groups, a total of twenty-four. These senators are elected at the beginning of each year by the members of their respective advisories and, as such, serve as their representatives. The Student Senate has two faculty advisors; their role is to facilitate meetings and to disseminate information on those proceedings, including legislation, proposals, or memoranda, to the full faculty or the board.      The Student Senate has served a variety of roles at Baxter, but its primary function has been the establishment and promotion of the school’s community norms. Early in the 2013-14 school year, with guidance from the faculty and student body, the Student Senate drafted and revised a school constitution. This constitution, known as the Baxtitution (see appendix 1), has been ratified by the faculty and currently serves as our official norms. Future amendments to the Baxtitution, should they become necessary, will be written by the Student Senate and ratified by the faculty. Any student accused of violating the norms enumerated in the Baxtitution is placed on our Behavior Step Ladder and, in most cases, is referred to our Student Judiciary Board, the judicial branch of student government.      To carry out its legislative work, the Student Senate has taken on an advisory role. Senators report any issues brought to their attention by their constituents (i.e. fellow advisees) to the Senate. If the Senate determines that the issue is significant enough to weigh in on, it is handed off to one of the six subcommittees that have been formed to mirror and collaborate with the six standing faculty committees.      A subcommittee can be tasked with drafting a policy memorandum or proposal to pass on to its partnering faculty committee. It can also be charged, by its partnering committee, to give feedback on a faculty proposal. The committees are as follows: Non-Formal Learning, School Culture, School Community, Community Connections, Operations and Facilities, and Academics. These partnerships give the student body a significant voice in policy formation and administration at Baxter Academy.      The Student Judiciary Board at Baxter Academy serves as the judicial branch of Baxter Academy Governance. While it is the responsibility of the Student Senate to inform the development of school norms and our Baxtitution, it is the responsibility of the Judiciary Board to hold members of our community accountable for violating the school norms as explained in the Baxtitution. As a result, students appearing before the Judiciary Board who are found guilty of violating school norms receive timely and appropriate consequences for their actions. It is important to note that all Judiciary Board proceedings are confidential.      The Judiciary Board is composed entirely of students. There is a faculty advisor who facilitates the hearing protocol and interacts with the principal, student defendant, parents, and other faculty members as needed. The faculty advisor also keeps track of cases and evaluates the completed consequences assigned by the student board.      A student who violates the Baxtitution may have a hearing before the Judiciary Board, or may choose to deal directly with administration. If the student chooses the hearing, then the Judiciary Board is convened. The charge is read and the student is given an opportunity to explain his or her actions. The student’s parents and advisor are invited to give any insight into why the student might have behaved in the manner being suggested. Throughout the hearing, the Jurors are allowed to ask questions. Once the hearing is completed, the Jurors vote on the guilt or innocence of the student defendant. If found guilty of the charge, the Jurors determine appropriate consequences.      The goal is to help the student defendant learn from this mistake and change the behavior so that it is not repeated. For example, a student found guilty of sexual harassment might have to research the consequences of this behavior in the workplace, create a public service announcement of some kind (video, poster, radio spot), and write a reflection about what that student learned and how his or her behavior impacted the victim.      This type of consequence is specific to the behavior and the student is more likely to learn than from a detention or a suspension. In some extreme cases, administration may need to take swift and clear action to insure student safety. Those are not cases for the Judiciary Board. ');";

If you do work in Maine—whether in a STEM field, or social services, or creative arts—Baxter wants to connect you with our students. We think you’ll soon witness the value of having young minds become acquainted with the most urgent problems you face and with your search for solutions. • Be a mentor. Share your expertise with students interested in learning more about the work you do—and what it takes to do it well. Your time is important to us, so you’ll give in a way that meets your needs. • Our internship program has been designed around students creating “deliverables” requested by partnering organizations. Students apply internally for the internships and must provide evidence to a faculty committee that they have the necessary skills and background to successfully meet the “client’s” needs. Examples of current internships include student teams making short documentaries for research institutes and hospitals; redesigning websites to integrate form and function; and working alongside scientists in labs. • Flex Friday flagship projects use interlocking teams of students to extend research and development for and with industry/research partners. We have teams of students working with industry leaders to improve student work while acquainting students with the real-world concerns of professionals in the field. Students use their CAD-skills to create prototypes. They crunch data. They do field research. Industry leaders have recognized how these real-world efforts accelerate the development of innovative thinkers with important cutting-edge skills. While visiting Baxter, the founder of Boston Dynamics said, “The key skills we look for in job applicants at Boston Dynamics are the ones we see being developed by students at Baxter Academy—and those skills are sometimes hard to find even among strong college graduates.” At Baxter, we believe that real-world partnerships accelerate and amplify the learning that matters most.

Baxter Academy is a public charter school in Portland, Maine. Its curriculum is rooted in inquiry and project-based learning and is connected across subjects.

Where is Baxter Academy? Baxter Academy is located in downtown Portland at 54 York Street. Who is Baxter Academy? Who are the students who thrive at Baxter? Baxter students are innovative and ethical. They are curious and motivated. They are willing to take risks, to fail, and to reflect in order to learn. They are inclusive of others. They take personal responsibility but are geared towards collaboration. They are musicians and photographers, martial artists and dancers, quarterbacks and video gamers. They love reading. Or taking apart cars and putting them back together. They collect LPs or books or trains. They may dream of being a doctor, a video game developer, a sustainability expert, a craftsman, an engineer, a designer, a climatologist, a cancer researcher, a wildlife photographer, or a ____________. What’s the faculty like? Baxter faculty are innovative and ethical. They are curious and motivated. They are willing to take risks, to fail, and to reflect in order to learn. They are inclusive of others. They take personal responsibility but are geared towards collaboration. As a group, they have taught all over the United States and Ukraine and China. Together, they speak many languages and play many musical instruments. Some are from Maine. Some are from away. One has built robots on US military contracts and another has built kayaks from cedar strips. One has a degree in particle physics but also experiments with photographic techniques from the Civil War. One teaches chemistry and writes murder mysteries. Every one of them is attentive, responsive, and caring. And they are still learning. Every day. What about the administration? Baxter’s administrative staff are innovative and ethical. They are curious and motivated... You see where we’re going with this: We think it’s important that the adults in the school share the same wonderful traits as the students. The school’s executive director, Carl Stasio, brings wisdom and nearly three decades of leadership experience in Maine education. Head of School Michele LaForge brims over with creativity in designing the school around its unique mission—and she is nurturing and tough-minded, too. What’s different about Baxter Academy? Baxter Academy offers a well-rounded education with an emphasis on deeply engaging students in hands-on study of science, technology, engineering, and math. Baxter has a robust and lively humanities department, as well as Mandarin language taught by a native speaker. Electives in 2013-14 have included music ensemble, photography, CAD, JAVA, furniture building, creative writing, journalism, and graphic design. Students engage in projects of their own choosing, as well as school-wide explorations that knit together the disciplines. On Fridays, the students work on FLEX FRIDAY group projects of their design and implementation. Each project has a faculty advisor. This year, some of those include an underwater robot, a canoe, a mural, a radio station, high-speed photography, video games, a green roof for the school, and mobility footgear for a virtual-reality platform. Inquiry leads the learning at Baxter. Students think for themselves. They analyze. They innovate. Busy work doesn’t happen here, but everyone is always busy with meaningful, exciting work.
