Ms. Pryor began her career early—as a sixteen-year-old reporter at her hometown newspaper. From that lucky jump-start, she developed a keen respect for the power of letting young people do the real work of the world. That respect is what attracted her to being part of the founding board that secured Baxter Academy’s charter and helped open the doors for students ready to get their hands on projects they love.<br/><br/>
After graduating summa cum laude from the University of Missouri’s School of Journalism, Ms. Pryor pursued her career in New York City, where she worked as everything from an intern at Life magazine to head of the research department at New York Magazine. She was on the start-up team for Entertainment Weekly, an experience that deeply informs the work she is doing at Baxter in its rigorous early years. Kelli is the author of both nonfiction and fiction books and is also a Sundance Screenwriting fellow, writing for studios such as Dreamworks, Warner Brothers, and Sony Pictures Entertainment, as well as for television.<br/><br/>
Since 2002, she has also been the director of the CAFAM Chinese School in Portland, where she has helped engineer a program that inspires learning through meaningful explorations of Chinese innovation, art, language, and culture. Her work at the Chinese School was inspired by her twin daughters’ love for Chinese culture, and it was their interest that first brought Baxter Academy to her attention. Her daughters will be part of Baxter’s second graduating class in 2017.

Michele LaForge is an exemplar Baxter Academy’s mission. The Head of School needs to be someone naturally sees the interconnectedness of one subject to another and that is Ms. LaForge. She has a background in both math and Russian literature. She is an avid reader who has worked in academic publishing. She is a creative and versatile educator who brings math alive in the world around her students by using her own curiosity to engage theirs.  She is also a highly competent leader who inspires the confidence and trust of teachers and administrators alike. Parents revere her.
<br/><br/>
Bob Strong, principal at Freeport High School, says of her: “Michele is a natural leader.  She has great ideas and presents them well, and brings people along. She has faced tough challenges but has moved her team by example. Her interpersonal skills are just remarkable.”
<br/><br/>
Her former principal at Freeport (now at USM), Tom Edwards, adds that “one fantasizes about who might be a successor, and I would’ve loved if Michele would have considered that [when I left four years ago]. Now she’s ready.”
<br/><br/>
Chris L’abbe, principal at Holy Cross, worked with Michele for many years at Freeport and says of her: “In Michele, you have a great leader who will bring your staff, students, and community together. She is one brilliant person who has leadership and people skills. She doesn’t shy away from anything hard. She is the best of the best.”
<br/><br/>
Michele herself states her philosophy best: “Everyone can learn. Learning is a product of the activity of the learners. Teachers are the guides, they create the best conditions for learning, they set guideposts, they ensure the standards are being met. They are model learners. They are professionals who act on the research in the field.”
<br/><br/>
Ms. LaForge lives with her husband and two daughters in Brunswick, close enough to walk to the bakery.
<br/><br/>
Fun facts about Ms. LaForge:  She quilts. She likes to read Jane Austen and science fiction and fantasy. She is learning to play the banjo. She likes new music better than she likes old music. She does not like peppers.

<br/>
Ms. Driver has spent the last six years working as a school counselor in the American International School of Rotterdam and at Gray-New Gloucester High School, where she has been the Director of Guidance. She grew up in southern Maine and pursued a BA in psychology at Skidmore College, and then a Master of Science in Counseling at the University of Southern Maine. 
<br/><br/>
Working with students from diverse backgrounds, Ms. Driver emphasizes helping young people plan for their lives beyond high school and college: “My hope is that all students will leave high school with the skills to make healthy decisions in many areas of their lives,” Ms. Driver says. “I like to help students feel empowered.”  She has helped hundreds of students navigate the college admissions and financial aid process. Her approach involves creating a four-year academic plan with students, as well as working with them to develop necessary skills, such as writing college essays and interpreting test scores. Many of her students have participated in dual-enrollment programs at local colleges and universities to earn college credits while still in high school.  She has also advised students interested in other post-secondary opportunities, including AmeriCorps, gap year programs, vocational training, and military options.
<br/><br/>
As schools nationwide begin the transition to standards-based grading, Ms. Driver has already been instrumental in working toward a proficiency-based transcript and diploma. She has created master schedules, working to ensure all of her students’ credits are in order for graduation.
<br/><br/>
To provide targeted support for struggling students, she works closely with teachers, parents, and administrators, and she has deep experience coordinating necessary referrals to alternative education programs and resources. She takes a proactive approach to individual and small-group counseling, as well as academic and crisis intervention.
<br/><br/>
Ms. Driver says, “I like a challenge. I believe in public education, but I also believe that continuing to do the same thing and expecting different results is madness. I’m ready to try something different. Baxter Academy's student-centered environment, collaboration between faculty, parents, and students, and passion for learning are inspiring, and I'm very excited to be a part of the community.””
<br/><br/>
Fun facts about Ms. Driver: She plays bass in various bluegrass ensembles and is learning to play old-time banjo. She likes to cook, boogie board, and tend to her urban garden. “I am most excited about my tomatillo plant,” she says, “but I keep that quiet because I don't want the other veggies to get jealous.”
