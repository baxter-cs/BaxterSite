Baxter Academy’s Executive Director, Carl Stasio, spent the past twenty-six years of his career as headmaster at one of Maine’s largest and oldest schools, Thornton Academy in Saco. Now he brings his wealth of experience and wisdom to bear on one of Maine’s youngest high schools. Mr. Stasio remarks every day how excited he is to be part working with Baxter: “Beginning any new venture is always exciting and starting a school from the ground up is truly wonderful. What a great opportunity it is to build a community of dynamic teachers and motivated students.”
<br/><br/>
At Thornton, Mr. Stasio led efforts to institute a middle school and an international boarding program while simultaneously broadening educational opportunities for all Thornton students. He traveled widely in Asia, visiting China seven times in the past decade, an experience that will enhance Baxter as it pursues its ties to a sister school near Shanghai. Through his work on the accreditation committee of the New England Association Of Schools and Colleges, Mr. Stasio has visited excellent schools in thirty-four countries around the world. He brings the best of innovative thinking in education to Baxter Academy.
<br/><br/>
“Baxter Academy benefits every day from Mr. Stasio’s strong curiosity and his deep experience. He is a forward-thinker who never neglects the lessons of the past,” says Kelli Pryor, chair of Baxter’s board of directors.
<br/><br/>
Mr. Stasio lives in Wells with his wife, Barbara. He is the father of five grown children.
<br/><br/>
Fun facts about Mr. Stasio: In high school, he took a bus every day from East Boston to Boston Latin Academy. He loves to read novels and can discuss the fine points of rock-and-roll. And he has a very stealthy sense of humor.

Michele LaForge is an exemplar Baxter Academy’s mission. The Head of School needs to be someone naturally sees the interconnectedness of one subject to another and that is Ms. LaForge. She has a background in both math and Russian literature. She is an avid reader who has worked in academic publishing. She is a creative and versatile educator who brings math alive in the world around her students by using her own curiosity to engage theirs.  She is also a highly competent leader who inspires the confidence and trust of teachers and administrators alike. Parents revere her.
<br/><br/>
Bob Strong, principal at Freeport High School, says of her: “Michele is a natural leader.  She has great ideas and presents them well, and brings people along. She has faced tough challenges but has moved her team by example. Her interpersonal skills are just remarkable.”
<br/><br/>
Her former principal at Freeport (now at USM), Tom Edwards, adds that “one fantasizes about who might be a successor, and I would’ve loved if Michele would have considered that [when I left four years ago]. Now she’s ready.”
<br/><br/>
Chris L’abbe, principal at Holy Cross, worked with Michele for many years at Freeport and says of her: “In Michele, you have a great leader who will bring your staff, students, and community together. She is one brilliant person who has leadership and people skills. She doesn’t shy away from anything hard. She is the best of the best.”
<br/><br/>
Michele herself states her philosophy best: “Everyone can learn. Learning is a product of the activity of the learners. Teachers are the guides, they create the best conditions for learning, they set guideposts, they ensure the standards are being met. They are model learners. They are professionals who act on the research in the field.”
<br/><br/>
Ms. LaForge lives with her husband and two daughters in Brunswick, close enough to walk to the bakery.
<br/><br/>
Fun facts about Ms. LaForge:  She quilts. She likes to read Jane Austen and science fiction and fantasy. She is learning to play the banjo. She likes new music better than she likes old music. She does not like peppers.

<br/>
Ms. Driver has spent the last six years working as a school counselor in the American International School of Rotterdam and at Gray-New Gloucester High School, where she has been the Director of Guidance. She grew up in southern Maine and pursued a BA in psychology at Skidmore College, and then a Master of Science in Counseling at the University of Southern Maine. 
<br/><br/>
Working with students from diverse backgrounds, Ms. Driver emphasizes helping young people plan for their lives beyond high school and college: “My hope is that all students will leave high school with the skills to make healthy decisions in many areas of their lives,” Ms. Driver says. “I like to help students feel empowered.”  She has helped hundreds of students navigate the college admissions and financial aid process. Her approach involves creating a four-year academic plan with students, as well as working with them to develop necessary skills, such as writing college essays and interpreting test scores. Many of her students have participated in dual-enrollment programs at local colleges and universities to earn college credits while still in high school.  She has also advised students interested in other post-secondary opportunities, including AmeriCorps, gap year programs, vocational training, and military options.
<br/><br/>
As schools nationwide begin the transition to standards-based grading, Ms. Driver has already been instrumental in working toward a proficiency-based transcript and diploma. She has created master schedules, working to ensure all of her students’ credits are in order for graduation.
<br/><br/>
To provide targeted support for struggling students, she works closely with teachers, parents, and administrators, and she has deep experience coordinating necessary referrals to alternative education programs and resources. She takes a proactive approach to individual and small-group counseling, as well as academic and crisis intervention.
<br/><br/>
Ms. Driver says, “I like a challenge. I believe in public education, but I also believe that continuing to do the same thing and expecting different results is madness. I’m ready to try something different. Baxter Academy's student-centered environment, collaboration between faculty, parents, and students, and passion for learning are inspiring, and I'm very excited to be a part of the community.””
<br/><br/>
Fun facts about Ms. Driver: She plays bass in various bluegrass ensembles and is learning to play old-time banjo. She likes to cook, boogie board, and tend to her urban garden. “I am most excited about my tomatillo plant,” she says, “but I keep that quiet because I don't want the other veggies to get jealous.”
