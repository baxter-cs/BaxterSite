<div class="centeredtext">
What is Baxter Academy?
Baxter Academy is a public charter school in Portland, Maine. Its curriculum is rooted in inquiry and project-based learning and is connected across subjects. Baxter opened in fall 2013 with a learning community of 130 freshman and sophomore students from more than 20 Maine towns. Its teacher to student ratio is 1:16. It is free to attend Baxter Academy.
Where is Baxter Academy?
Baxter Academy is located in downtown Portland at 54 York Street.
Who is Baxter Academy?
Who are the students who thrive at Baxter?
Baxter students are innovative and ethical. They are curious and motivated. They are willing to take risks, to fail, and to reflect in order to learn. They are inclusive of others. They take personal responsibility but are geared towards collaboration. They are musicians and photographers, martial artists and dancers, quarterbacks and video gamers. They love reading. Or taking apart cars and putting them back together. They collect LPs or books or trains. They may dream of being a doctor, a video game inventor, a sustainability expert, a craftsman, a robotics engineer, a designer, a climatologist, a cancer researcher, a wildlife photographer, or a ____________.
What’s the faculty like?
Baxter faculty are innovative and ethical. They are curious and motivated. They are willing to take risks, to fail, and to reflect in order to learn. They are inclusive of others. They take personal responsibility but are geared towards collaboration. As a group, they have taught all over the United States and Ukraine and China. Together, they speak many languages and play many musical instruments. Some are from Maine. Some are from away. One has built robots on US military contracts and another has built kayaks from cedar strips. One has a degree in particle physics but also experiments with photographic techniques from the Civil War. One teaches chemistry and writes murder mysteries. Every one of them is attentive, responsive, and caring. And they are still learning. Every day.
What about the administration?
Baxter’s administrative staff are innovative and ethical. They are curious and motivated... You see where we’re going with this: We think it’s important that the adults in the school share the same wonderful traits as the students. The school’s executive director, Carl Stasio, brings wisdom and nearly three decades of leadership experience in Maine education. Head of School Michele LaForge brims over with creativity in designing the school around its unique mission—and she is nurturing and tough-minded, too. 
What’s different about Baxter Academy?
Baxter Academy offers a well-rounded education with an emphasis on deeply engaging students in hands-on study of science, technology, engineering, and math. Baxter has a robust and lively humanities department, as well as Mandarin language taught by a native speaker. Electives in 2013-14 have included music ensemble, photography, CAD, JAVA, furniture building, creative writing, journalism, and graphic design. Students engage in projects of their own choosing, as well as school-wide explorations that knit together the disciplines. On Fridays, the students work on FLEX FRIDAY group projects of their design and implementation. Each project has a faculty advisor. This year, some of those include an underwater robot, a canoe, a mural, a radio station, high-speed photography, video games, a green roof for the school, and mobility footgear for a virtual-reality platform. Inquiry leads the learning at Baxter. Students think for themselves. They analyze. They innovate. Busy work doesn’t happen here, but everyone is always busy with meaningful, exciting work.

<cms:editable name='senatecontent' type='richtext'>
The Student Senate serves as the legislative branch of student government at Baxter Academy and ensures that students have a voice in creating and evaluating school policy. The Student Senate is composed of one senator from each of Baxter Academy’s advisory groups, a total of twenty-four. These senators are elected at the beginning of each year by the members of their respective advisories and, as such, serve as their representatives. The Student Senate has two faculty advisors; their role is to facilitate meetings and to disseminate information on those proceedings, including legislation, proposals, or memoranda, to the full faculty or the board. The Student Senate has served a variety of roles at Baxter, but its primary function has been the establishment and promotion of the school’s community norms. Early in the 2013-14 school year, with guidance from the faculty and student body, the Student Senate drafted and revised a school constitution. This constitution, known as the Baxtitution (see appendix 1), has been ratified by the faculty and currently serves as our official norms. Future amendments to the Baxtitution, should they become necessary, will be written by the Student Senate and ratified by the faculty. Any student accused of violating the norms enumerated in the Baxtitution is placed on our Behavior Step Ladder and, in most cases, is referred to our Student Judiciary Board, the judicial branch of student government. To carry out its legislative work, the Student Senate has taken on an advisory role. Senators report any issues brought to their attention by their constituents (i.e. fellow advisees) to the Senate. If the Senate determines that the issue is significant enough to weigh in on, it is handed off to one of the six subcommittees that have been formed to mirror and collaborate with the six standing faculty committees. A subcommittee can be tasked with drafting a policy memorandum or proposal to pass on to its partnering faculty committee. It can also be charged, by its partnering committee, to give feedback on a faculty proposal. The committees are as follows: Non-Formal Learning, School Culture, School Community, Community Connections, Operations and Facilities, and Academics. These partnerships give the student body a significant voice in policy formation and administration at Baxter Academy.

    <h2 id="mission" class="fullwidthmission">Judiciary Board</h2>
</section>

<div class="centeredtext">
<cms:editable name='jboardcontent' type='richtext'>
The Student Judiciary Board at Baxter Academy serves as the judicial branch of Baxter Academy Governance. While it is the responsibility of the Student Senate to inform the development of school norms and our Baxtitution, it is the responsibility of the Judiciary Board to hold members of our community accountable for violating the school norms as explained in the Baxtitution. As a result, students appearing before the Judiciary Board who are found guilty of violating school norms receive timely and appropriate consequences for their actions. It is important to note that all Judiciary Board proceedings are confidential. The Judiciary Board is composed entirely of students. There is a faculty advisor who facilitates the hearing protocol and interacts with the principal, student defendant, parents, and other faculty members as needed. The faculty advisor also keeps track of cases and evaluates the completed consequences assigned by the student board. A student who violates the Baxtitution may have a hearing before the Judiciary Board, or may choose to deal directly with administration. If the student chooses the hearing, then the Judiciary Board is convened. The charge is read and the student is given an opportunity to explain his or her actions. The student’s parents and advisor are invited to give any insight into why the student might have behaved in the manner being suggested. Throughout the hearing, the Jurors are allowed to ask questions. Once the hearing is completed, the Jurors vote on the guilt or innocence of the student defendant. If found guilty of the charge, the Jurors determine appropriate consequences. The goal is to help the student defendant learn from this mistake and change the behavior so that it is not repeated. For example, a student found guilty of sexual harassment might have to research the consequences of this behavior in the workplace, create a public service announcement of some kind (video, poster, radio spot), and write a reflection about what that student learned and how his or her behavior impacted the victim. This type of consequence is specific to the behavior and the student is more likely to learn than from a detention or a suspension. In some extreme cases, administration may need to take swift and clear action to insure student safety. Those are not cases for the Judiciary Board.

<cms:editable name='flexfriday' type='richtext'>
Outside of our national school system, work in the “real world” is about solving large-scale problems, learning from failure, building on previous work, collaborating with colleagues, critiquing and iterating designs, and managing time and resources. None of these is possible within the constraints of a conventional school schedule. Flex Friday is designed to alleviate many of these issues. It provides large blocks of time for students to perform lengthy experiments, immerse themselves in project design or research, and, through error analysis, learn from failure. Because all students have the same time available, groups of students are able to coalesce around projects of common interest and work collaboratively without scheduling difficulties. The significant amount of time permits students to work through a rigorous autonomous open-ended project development process, reaching beyond textbooks or previous learning to access the necessary information. Teachers, freed from other teaching obligations, are able to focus on advising students as they work through their projects, assisting with skill development and making sure they ask the right questions, follow through on their work plans and collaborate effectively within work groups. The blocks of time facilitate the development of web-based research skills and the ability to work with collaborating businesses and other institutions. While the nature of student projects varies, the underlying lessons are the same. Some students may choose to work in a large group to develop an experimental model for a fish hatchery, others may want to work individually on a writing a database program with a local company. In both cases students must work through prescribed procedures. Both cases require students to define the project objectives, be responsible for time, budget, and project management, and to devise iterative creative solutions to a given problem. In most cases, projects give back to the community. Flex Friday fosters the skills needed to succeed in the real world; these skills require time, responsibility, and creativity; and they are found outside of the standard high school curriculum. A student’s Flex Friday project begins with an idea. Finding student collaborators, and working with a teacher, students prepare a formal proposal describing the project details. Schedules, finances, outcomes, and connections to learning are all integral parts of that proposal. Once completed, the proposal is submitted for approval (or revision), and then the project and the project team is off and running. All students participate in a culminating, public Project Presentation at the end of the year.
